### Added

- SDD: REQ-N10 and ADR-0007 record that the public website lives in its own repository and consumes `docs/install.md` from here.

### Changed

- Docs: restructured the README and line-edited the contributor docs, correcting stale `make ci` and configuration details.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Guides: new template-design guide `templates/cgem-framework` and runtime-serialisation guides `templates/opt-structure` and `templates/web-template`.
- Guides: new spec digests — PROC (overview, task-planning, decision-language), CNF, and `lang-bmm3`.
- SDD: machine-checked traceability — a `.sdd.yaml` descriptor, a `traceability.yaml` map, and a `spec-check` CI drift gate.
- SDD: new REQ-N9 covering CI validation of published MCP tool input/output schemas.

### Changed

- Guides: broadened AQL versioning coverage (`VERSION` / `LATEST_VERSION` / `ALL_VERSIONS`, node/name predicates) and tightened ADL 1.4 archetype alignment.
- Guides: extended the Simplified Formats guides (ordinal/proportion suffixes, participations, `ctx` defaults) and template serialisation guidance.
- Guides: refreshed the `specs/` digests to development-branch class names and relations.
- Prompts: aligned tool lists and workflows with current tools; added a CKM reuse-check, explain-only guardrails, and a `type_specification_explorer` coverage fix.
- Prompts: consolidated the two CKM explorer prompts into a single `ckm_explorer`.
- Dependencies: upgrade `mcp/sdk` to `^0.7` (eager element loading retained); refresh Guzzle, PHPUnit, PHPStan, and Symfony.
- Tools: `guide_search` scoring is case-insensitive, Unicode-aware, and drops zero-score hits; `taskType` only re-ranks.
- Tools: stricter input/output schemas (`additionalProperties: false`, nullable optional enums, required envelopes) — **breaking** for strict MCP clients.
- Tools: search envelopes gained a `total` companion, counted before the result cap.
- Tools: `guide_search` and `examples_search` share one query tokenizer; `topCandidates` no longer limits recall.
- Prompts: real prompt arguments with safe `{{name}}` substitution — **breaking** for clients relying on parameterless `prompts/get`.
- Prompts: `task_type` uses one vocabulary (`design | review`, plus `specialise` for archetypes) and is validated, as are review/artefact pairings — **breaking** for clients sending the old per-prompt tokens.
- Prompts/docs: shared policy documented as a resilience layer, conditional full-rewrite output, and retrieved content treated as data.
- Docs/guides: aligned `spec-lookup` wording on the `development` spec stream and dropped a false `guide_get` chunking claim.
- Resources: Examples resource template no longer advertises an incorrect shared MIME type.
- Server: the MCP discovery cache is namespaced by `APP_VERSION`; upgrading without a version bump requires clearing the cache (see [development.md](docs/development.md#gotcha--mcp-discovery-cache)).
- Server instructions: ~13% shorter after folding thrice-stated discovery guidance into one policy bullet; guidance unchanged.

### Fixed

- Tools: multibyte-safe snippet slicing across the search tools; malformed UTF-8 previously broke the JSON-RPC response.
- Tools: `guide_search` no longer returns an empty result for terms that appear only in a guide body.
- Tools: CKM search rejects a drifted response envelope and logs dropped fields instead of reporting zero matches.
- Tools: `type_specification_get` rejects a malformed BMM document instead of returning an incomplete payload.
- Prompts: malformed or non-string arguments and unsubstitutable `{{tokens}}` are rejected by name.
- Tools: CKM and terminology failures surface as tool errors carrying their message instead of a generic protocol error.
- Tools: `ckm_archetype_get` reports an unresolvable identifier instead of mangling it into a doomed request — **breaking** for callers passing neither a CID nor an archetype-id.
- Tools: CKM searches always score a minimum candidate window, so a small `maxResults` no longer changes which matches rank highest.
- Resources: unreadable guide/example files are logged rather than silently dropped from `resources/list`.
- Build: restored `make inspector` against MCP Inspector v2 — pinned image with an OS keyring, seeded dev targets, and a fixed auth-URL match.
- Server: warn instead of silently starting without server instructions; harden bootstrap crash handling and preserve exception cause chain.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Tools: human-readable titles and behaviour annotations (read-only / idempotent / open-world hints) across all tools; optional `rmClass` filter on `ckm_archetype_search`.
- Guides: new `templates/serialization-formats` (OET vs OPT vs ADL-Designer `.t.json` vs web-template) and Dutch `archetypes/language-standards-nl`; OET attribute reference and a `DV_SCALE` vs `DV_ORDINAL` rating-scale idiom added to the archetype/template guides.

### Changed

- Tools: improved CKM search recall and ranking (wider candidate window, exact-concept boost, scoring aliases); trimmed redundant value-lists from parameter descriptions where an `enum` constraint already conveys the options.
- Guides: refined archetype lint rules (idiomatic `ITEM_TREE.items {0..*}`, translation-accuracy and prose↔slot consistency checks) and a reuse-survey containers-vs-content note.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- Tools: retuned CKM archetype/template search scoring — wider status gap (DRAFT now ranks above INITIAL more reliably) and gentler age decay.

### Fixed

- Transport: collapse a duplicated `Host` header before the DNS-rebinding check, fixing 403 "Invalid Host header" behind proxies that send `Host` twice.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Tools: JSON Schema `enum` constraints on the `format`, `kind`, `category`, and `component` parameters.
- Docs: Specification-Driven Development set under `docs/` (requirements, architecture, decision records, traceability), plus `install.md` and `conventions.md`.
- Build: `make ci` target; the MCP Inspector now runs on the dev Docker network.
- Config: `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` allow-list for the `streamable-http` transport (SDK ≥ 0.6 DNS-rebinding protection).

### Changed

- Dependencies: upgraded `mcp/sdk` to `^0.6` and `symfony/cache` to `^8`; refreshed Guzzle/Symfony.
- Docs: restructured `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for progressive disclosure (compact user-facing README; setup and conventions moved into `docs/`).
- Resources: regenerated the `LANG` BMM schema resources.
- Repo: track shared AI-assistant config (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`) and enable the maintainer dev plugin.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Guides: new `specs` and `howto` categories (spec digests + toolchain how-tos); new `LANG` BMM component.
- Examples: new `openehr://examples/{kind}/{name}` namespace with `examples_search` / `examples_get` (AQL, FLAT, STRUCTURED, ADL archetypes).
- MCP `instructions`: `Spec-Lookup-First`, `Digest-First`, and `Examples-First` clauses.
- MCP conformance tests via Docker.

### Changed

- Retired `rm` category (migrated to `specs/`); digests track `development`.
- Moved guide-authoring scaffolding from `resources/guides/` to `src/templates/`.
- Refreshed BMM JSON across AM/AM2/BASE/RM.
- Extracted `TerminologyXmlLoader` helper.
- Hardened guide / type-spec identifier handling (path-traversal checks).
- Bumped Symfony + phpdocumentor dependencies.

### Fixed

- `AbstractPrompt`: error message for missing user block.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Guides: Added RM guides for demographic model, EHR information model, and platform services with comprehensive summaries. Expanded AQL checklist with stored query governance and operational readiness. Added shared policy and refined related-resources references across guides.
- MCP Conformance: Added `make conformance` to run the official MCP conformance suite against the server over HTTP. Requires dev stack (`make up-dev`). Results written to `conformance/`; expected failures in `tests/conformance-baseline.yml`. Added `node` service to dev compose (Node 22 + curl) built from multistage Dockerfile target `node`.
- Tests: Added PromptCompositionTest and PromptPolicySeparationTest; expanded CkmServiceTest and GuideServiceTest for scoring, sizing, and ranking behaviour.

### Changed

- Tools: CKM archetype and template search now use enhanced scoring, fetch sizing/slicing, and increased default max results. Guide search refactored (dropped guides-index.json persistence); improved heading extraction and ranking. Removed redundant descriptions in guide properties to reduce context bloat.
- Prompts: Centralized global policy in server instructions; streamlined prompt roles and task guidelines and reduced prompt text. Refined design_or_review and explain prompts across archetypes, templates, AQL, and simplified formats.
- Guides: Refined ADL syntax and terminology (paths, identifiers); updated archetype guides (anti-patterns, structural constraints, terminology, reference formatting, language standards, principles, checklist), OET syntax, and simplified formats principles. Enhanced translation standards and terminology practices.
- Docs: README recommends pairing with openEHR Assistant Plugin. AGENTS.md documents Docker-only runtime and MCP conformance workflow. Server instructions refined for tool usage and output policy.

### Fixed

- Tools: Resolved PHPStan warnings in heading extraction.
- Tests: Removed xdebug ini setting for CI compatibility. Marked policy separation test as covers-nothing.
