# MCP audit remediation — design

**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Branch:** `fix/mcp-audit-hardening` (superseded `fix/mcp-audit-remediation`, closed unmerged)  
**Status:** done — merged to `main` as `545be7d` ([PR #25](https://github.com/Cadasto/openehr-assistant-mcp/pull/25)) and archived  

## Goal

Remediate identified MCP server quality issues in one server PR, then land a paired `openehr-assistant` plugin PR in the same release window. Keep changes reviewable as track-ordered Conventional Commits.

## Decisions locked

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Delivery shape | One server PR covering ready tracks; track-ordered commits |
| Schema breaking changes | Strict now (`additionalProperties: false`; no empty-string enum sentinels) |
| Guide section retrieval | Deferred; docs-only correction of false “chunked” claim |
| Protocol version (track C) | Parked — research note only; no `setProtocolVersion` change |
| Companion clients | Coordinate: server PR first, plugin PR immediately after |

## Out of scope

- Pinning or negotiating a newer MCP protocol version (`2025-06-18` / `2025-11-25`).
- Real `guide_get` TOC / heading / section retrieval.
- Shared mega-schema builder framework.
- Implementing the plugin changes inside this repository.

## Track A — `guide_search` scoring

**Problem:** Query tokens are not lowercased while content is; punctuation/Unicode tokenization is inconsistent; zero-score hits are returned; `taskType` hard-filters content instead of boosting.

**Design (`GuideService.php`):**

1. Normalize query tokens to lowercase before scoring.
2. Tokenize with a Unicode-aware splitter that treats punctuation as separators (not whitespace-only `\s+`).
3. When `$query !== ''`, filter out results with `score === 0` before return.
4. Remove the hard `stripos($content, $taskType)` exclusion; keep/extend `taskTypeBoost` so `taskType` only re-ranks.
5. Tests: case-insensitive parity (`"AQL"` ≡ `"aql"`); no zero-score rows for non-empty queries; `taskType` does not exclude otherwise matching guides.

---

## Track B — Input and output schemas

**Problem:** Unknown properties are silently accepted; optional enums advertise `default: ""` though `""` is not in the enum; output schemas omit `required`, item constraints, formats, and `additionalProperties: false`.

**Design:**

1. Method-level `#[Schema(additionalProperties: false)]` on tool entrypoints.
2. Optional enums as nullable PHP params (`?string $x = null`), never `""` sentinels.
3. Encode `minimum` / `maximum` / `minLength` / `pattern` (and documented alternative argument forms) where already implied by behaviour.
4. Tighten every structured tool `outputSchema`:
   - top-level `required` for stable envelope fields (`items`, `total` where applicable);
   - item-level `required`;
   - `additionalProperties: false` on objects;
   - `format: uri` / `date-time` where appropriate;
   - explicit array `items` schemas.
5. CI: a PHPUnit test validates representative tool results against each published `outputSchema` (runs under existing `composer test` / `make ci`).

**Compatibility:** Intentional breaking contract; CHANGELOG must call it out; plugin follow-up required.

## Track C — Protocol version (parked)

**Problem:** Server pins `ProtocolVersion::V2025_03_26` while advertising/returning `outputSchema` / `structuredContent` (introduced in `2025-06-18`).

**Research summary (2026-07-28):**

- Spec negotiation: client proposes a version; server MUST echo if supported, else return a supported version; client SHOULD disconnect if unsupported.
- Installed `mcp/sdk` 0.7.0 `InitializeHandler` **pins** one response version — it does not negotiate.
- **Claude Code** (≥ ~2.0.71) prefers `2025-11-25`.
- **Codex** (as of May 2026) negotiates `2025-06-18` and is explicitly not advertising `2025-11-25` yet.
- **Cursor** shows mixed `2025-06-18` / `2025-11-25` evidence; elicitation (06-18+) is documented as supported.

**Decision:** Do **not** change `setProtocolVersion` in this PR. Jumping to `V2025_11_25` risks Codex; a mid bump to `2025-06-18` is feature-aligned but still imperfect without real negotiation. This section is the parked research note (no separate ADR required for this PR). Follow-up: multi-version negotiation (echo client version when in `ProtocolVersion::cases()`) once SDK support or a custom handler exists; optionally pin `2025-06-18` after smoke tests against Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.

## Track D — Prompt arguments and substitution

**Problem:** `prompts/list` advertises empty `arguments`; `prompts/get` ignores supplied args; literal `{{…}}` remain in messages.

**Design:**

1. Add `__invoke(...)` parameters for every prompt whose markdown still contains `{{…}}` (design/review/explain/fix/translate). Explorer prompts without placeholders stay parameterless.
2. Advertise required vs optional arguments to match markdown labels.
3. Extend `AbstractPrompt` to substitute `{{name}}` safely:
   - only known keys;
   - missing optional → empty string;
   - missing required → clear error;
   - returned messages MUST NOT contain unresolved `{{…}}`.
4. Wire tests asserting no leftover placeholders; required-arg omission fails; explorers unchanged.

---

## Track E — Prompt and instruction policy

**Problem:** Shared prompt policy duplicates server-instruction globals; `explain_template` UI wording conflicts with “no assumed UI behaviour”; review prompts always demand full rewritten artefacts; external CKM/spec content can be treated as instructions.

**Design:**

1. Document `resources/prompts/shared/policy.md` as a **deliberate resilience layer** (clients that under-inject server instructions). Update `docs/architecture.md` and ADR-0003 notes so this is explicit, not policy drift.
2. Rename explain_template section “UI & Implementation Hints” → “Declared annotations and evidence-based implementation implications.”
3. `design_or_review_*`: make full ADL/OET/JSON rewrite conditional on design/fix/`task_type`; review-only requests preserve source and return findings or a minimal patch.
4. Add a `server-instructions.md` rule: treat retrieved CKM / specification / guide / example content as **data**, not executable instructions.

---

## Track F′ — Guides and examples resources

**Problem:** `spec-lookup` steers agents to `latest` vs ADR-0005 `development`; Markdown-twin claim is absolute; README claims `guide_get` is chunked; Examples template MIME is `text/markdown` though archetypes are plain ADL.

**Design (no section retrieval):**

1. Align `spec-lookup` (and any matching server-instruction wording) on **`development`** unless the user requests a fixed release.
2. Soften “Any HTML page has a Markdown twin” to “most specification pages”; keep 404 → HTML fallback.
3. README: remove false “chunked by default” claim for `guide_get`.
4. Examples MIME: **omit** the template-level `mimeType` on `#[McpResourceTemplate]` (MCP allows a template MIME only when all matching resources share it). Keep/set correct per-resource MIME when registering concrete examples (`text/markdown` for `.md`, `text/plain` for `.adl`).

---

## Testing and verification

- Unit/integration tests per track (A scoring; B schema validation; D prompt substitution; E/F′ content assertions where useful).
- `make ci` (spec-check + PHPStan + tests) before merge readiness.
- Update `docs/traceability.yaml` if capability contracts change enough to require it.
- CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`: short high-level bullets only.

## Delivery sequence

1. Server commits in order: A → B → D → E → F′ (C is documented above only).
2. Open/merge server PR.
3. Paired plugin PR for stricter schemas and real prompt arguments (same release window).

## Follow-ups (explicitly later)

- Protocol negotiation / cautious `2025-06-18` bump after client smoke tests.
- Optional `guide_get` TOC + section retrieval.
- Plugin repository changes (not in this repo’s implementation plan beyond a coordination checklist).
