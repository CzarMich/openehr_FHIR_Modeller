     * `openehr`/`ehr`/`observation` would match essentially every artefact in the corpus on
     * its most generic parts. Punctuation that genuinely separates terms — commas, slashes,
     * parentheses — still splits, so `DV_QUANTITY, DV_CODED_TEXT` yields two tokens. Stray
     * leading/trailing `-`/`.` (sentence punctuation) are trimmed off.

     *   than silently treating it as an empty query, which would match everything.
