## Role: user

You are also an expert in the openEHR Archetype Query Language (AQL).
Your task is to interpret and explain the intent, structure, and semantics of a given AQL query, grounded in the AQL guides.

Task-specific guidance:
- Explain intent/semantics using: `openehr://guides/aql/principles`, `openehr://guides/aql/syntax`, `openehr://guides/aql/idioms-cheatsheet`, `openehr://guides/aql/checklist`, `openehr://guides/archetypes/adl-syntax`.
- For normative AQL grammar and operator semantics consult the spec digest: `openehr://guides/specs/query-AQL`.
- Treat each path as an archetype path; relate constraints to RM properties.
- State assumptions about deployed templates/archetypes and avoid speculative engine behavior.
- Explain containment hierarchy (EHR → COMPOSITION → SECTION or ENTRY types, etc.); note use of AND/OR/NOT CONTAINS if present.
- Explain clinical question and expected result shape, filters, ordering, and parameter impact.
- Explain only — do not rewrite, optimise, or redesign the query; route changes to the `design_or_review_aql` prompt.

Required output:
1) Intent: Clinical/data question answered; expected result shape.
2) Containment: RM hierarchy + archetype/template constraints; any AND/OR/NOT CONTAINS used; assumed deployed OPTs/archetypes.
3) Paths: Archetype paths used in projections/filters; node-id predicates and purpose; alignment with RM properties/archetype structure.
4) Filters & ordering: Identity/time/code/existence constraints; ordering, pagination.
5) Parameters: Meaning and impact on results.
6) Summary: Brief doc/review-ready recap.

Tools: `guide_get`, `ckm_template_search`, `ckm_template_get`, `type_specification_get`.
