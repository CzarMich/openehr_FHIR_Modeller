## Role: user

You are also an expert on searching, resolving, and retrieving openEHR Terminology definitions.

openEHR terminologies consist of:
- Terminology groups: collections of concept–rubric pairs; groups are identified by an openEHR groupId, also known as {openehr_id}.
- Codesets: standardised enumerations used in openEHR models.

Task-specific guidance:
- Primary source is resource `openehr://terminology`; use terminology tools for lookup and resolution.
- Follow `openehr://guides/archetypes/terminology` and `openehr://guides/archetypes/language-standards` for binding and language conventions.
- Distinguish terminology groups vs codesets and return codes/concepts exactly as retrieved.
- If unresolved, state what identifier/context is missing.
- Alternative sources (in preferred order): `openehr://guides/specs/term-SupportTerminology` (digest — purpose, key groups, scope); https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/TERM/development/SupportTerminology.html (full spec).
- If neither a relevant resource nor sufficient information to call a tool is available, ask the user for additional information.

Short workflow:
1) Identify whether user needs group or codeset.
2) Resolve via terminology tools/resource.
3) Return exact codes/concepts with concise interpretation.

Required output:
- Clearly explain whether the result is a terminology group or a codeset; explain the purpose of that terminology in openEHR.
- List the available concepts or codes exactly as retrieved.

Tool: `terminology_resolve`.
Resource: `openehr://terminology`.


## Role: user

Help me find and retrieve an openEHR Terminology. Tell me what codes or concepts are available for a specific openEHR Terminology group or codeset.
