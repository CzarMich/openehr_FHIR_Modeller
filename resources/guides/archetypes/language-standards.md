# openEHR Archetype Language Standards Guide

**Scope:** Language, spelling, terminology, and translation conventions for archetype authoring and localization  
**Related:** `openehr://guides/archetypes/terminology`, `openehr://guides/archetypes/reference-formatting`  
**Keywords:** language, English, international, translation, cultural neutrality, terminology, metadata, sentence case

---

## A. Original Language Requirement

- **A1:** All archetypes for international CKM federation SHALL use English (ISO-639-1 code: `en`) as the original language.
- **A2:** English as the original language prevents message degradation through repeated translations — semantic drift from translation chains.
- **A3:** The `original_language` attribute in archetype metadata SHALL be set to `en` (or equivalent ISO-639-1 code).
- **A4:** All term definitions, descriptions, purpose, use, and misuse statements SHALL be authored in English before translation.
- **A5:** Internal terminology (at-codes, ac-codes) identifiers and structure SHALL NOT change across translations; translations apply only to human-readable text.

---

## B. English Language Conventions

### Metadata Case and Punctuation

- **B1:** Concept names and data element names SHALL use sentence case: first letter uppercase, subsequent letters lowercase, except proper nouns and acronyms.
  - Correct: "Neurologic assessment in neuro-oncology (NANO) scale"
  - Incorrect: "Neurologic Assessment In Neuro-Oncology Scale (NANO)"

- **B2:** Abbreviations SHALL be placed immediately after the words they abbreviate, not at the end.
  - Correct: "Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale"
  - Incorrect: "Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology scale (NANO)"

- **B3:** All descriptions and purpose statements SHALL end with a full stop (period) or equivalent terminal punctuation. Concept names and data element names MUST NOT end with full stops.

- **B4:** Use hyphens with spaces for bullet points and lists: `- item text`

### Metadata Statement Patterns

- **B5:** Purpose statements SHALL begin with "To record..." followed by a clinically-oriented definition.
  - Example: "To record the local measurement of arterial blood pressure which is a surrogate for arterial pressure in the systemic circulation."

- **B6:** Use statements SHALL begin with "Use to record..." followed by clinical context and application boundaries.
  - Example: "Use to record all representations of systemic arterial blood pressure measurement, no matter which method or body location is used to record it."

- **B7:** Misuse statements SHALL begin with "Not to be used..." followed by what archetype or approach should be used instead.
  - Example: "Not to be used to record 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; use the OBSERVATION.ambulatory_blood_pressure archetype instead."

- **B8:** All Purpose, Use, and Misuse statements SHALL end with a full stop.

### Data Element Naming Patterns

- **B9:** Data element names SHALL use established clinical naming conventions:
  - `<XYZ> tested` or `<XYZ> examined` — identify the object examined
  - `<XYZ> name` — the name or code assigned to the concept
  - `<XYZ> commenced` — start date or time
  - `<XYZ> ceased` — stop date or time
  - `Category` — broader, less specific grouping
  - `Type` — narrower, more specific classification

- **B10:**

Example: `Category` for an overarching grouping for an intervention identified in 'Intervention name'; `Type` for a more specific method or process for delivering an intervention identified in ‘Intervention name’.

### Data Element Descriptions and Comments

- **B11:** Data element descriptions (term definitions in the ontology) SHALL contain the clinical definition only — what the element represents and why it matters clinically.
  - Example: "The measured force exerted by blood on the walls of the artery when the heart contracts."

- **B12:** Usage examples or detailed implementation guidance for data elements MUST be placed in a comment field (separate from the description), not embedded in the description text itself. Examples in comments SHALL be prefixed with "For example: ".
  - Correct: Description is the definition; comment contains "For example: 120/80 mmHg, 140/90 mmHg"
  - Incorrect: "The measured force exerted by blood on the walls of the artery when the heart contracts. Examples: 120/80 mmHg, 140/90 mmHg." (in description)

- **B13:** This separation ensures:
  - Descriptions remain concise and clinically focused
  - Examples and notes are clearly distinguished as implementation guidance, not part of the formal definition
  - Localization and translation focus on the clinical definition without redundant repetition

---

## C. International English and Cultural Neutrality

- **C1:** Archetypes SHALL avoid locale-specific semantics, assumptions about healthcare systems, or regional medical references.

- **C2:** Clinical terminology choices SHALL be internationally recognized and, where possible, aligned with authoritative standards.

- **C3:** When equivalent medical terms exist across English variants (American, British, Australian), use terminology that is clinically unambiguous and internationally accepted.
  - Example: For screening and consent contexts, use "Unsure" (indicates personal doubt) rather than "Uncertain" (implies unpredictability) or "Indeterminate" (implies clinical assessment).
  - Rationale: This aligns with established psychological and clinical terminology in international consensus.

- **C4:** Do NOT encode regional measurements, healthcare system assumptions, or jurisdiction-specific legal requirements at the archetype level.

- **C5:** Avoid idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, or culturally-specific references in term definitions and descriptions.

- **C6:** Use neutral, clinically-standard phrasing for all descriptions; prefer objective clinical language over subjective or narrative phrasing.

---

## D. Terminology Consistency

- **D1:** The same clinical concept SHALL be represented by the same internal term (at-code) and description throughout the archetype.

- **D2:** If a concept has multiple valid names or synonyms, consolidate them into a single canonical term with synonyms noted in the description or Comment section.

- **D3:** Consistency is enforced through:
  - Stable internal terminology (at-codes) linked to fixed definitions
  - External terminology bindings (SNOMED CT, LOINC, etc.) providing semantic equivalence
  - Translation mechanisms preserving clinical intent across languages

- **D4:** Spelling variants (e.g., British "haemoglobin" vs. American "hemoglobin", or "foetus" vs. "fetus") are handled by external terminology bindings, not by creating multiple archetype terms.
  - Rationale: A single SNOMED CT concept code represents the same clinical entity regardless of spelling variant; external bindings provide disambiguation.

- **D5:** Do not create separate at-codes for spelling or terminology variants of the same clinical concept.

---

## E. Translation and Per-Language Framework

### Translation Philosophy

- **E1:** Translations are NOT literal word-for-word conversions; they SHALL preserve clinical intent while using natural phrasing in the target language.

- **E2:** Each translated archetype SHALL use the target language's established clinical register, terminology, and grammatical conventions. 

- **E3:** Translated term definitions (term_definitions in target language) SHALL be clinically appropriate and idiomatic in the target language, even if phrasing differs from the English source. Follow authority language guidelines (e.g., SNOMED CT translation rules for the target language).

- **E4:** All metadata elements (Purpose, Use, Misuse, descriptions) SHALL be translated to reflect clinical practice and terminology in the target language/locale.

- **E5:** Translations SHALL NOT alter:
  - Internal identifiers (at-codes, ac-codes, id-codes)
  - Archetype structure (path hierarchy)
  - Constraints (occurrences, cardinalities), units, value sets
  - Existing terminology bindings (SNOMED CT, LOINC codes remain identical)

- **E6:** Consistency within a translated archetype SHALL be maintained: the same translated term SHOULD be used for the same at-code throughout the translation.

- **E7:** If source text is ambiguous or incorrect, provide a best-effort translation and flag it in warnings/notes for clinical review. Do not invent new concepts, merge/split terms, change scope, or alter numeric/code systems.

### Per-Language Guidance Structure

- **E8:** Language-specific guidance documents MAY be created following the pattern: `language-standards-<iso-639-1-code>.md`
  - Examples: `language-standards-nb.md` (Norwegian Bokmål), `language-standards-de.md` (German), `language-standards-fr.md` (French)

- **E9:** Per-language guides SHALL:
  - Establish clinical terminology standards for the target language
  - Document established translations of common archetype terms
  - Provide examples of Purpose/Use/Misuse statements in the target language
  - Reference authoritative clinical terminology sources for the language/region
  - Maintain consistency with this base English language standards guide

- **E10:** Per-language guides SHOULD extend this guide by:
  - Specifying which translation approach (formal, natural, hybrid) is appropriate for the language
  - Documenting established terminology in target-language clinical registers
  - Providing example archetypes with proper translations

---

## F. Terminology Binding and Spelling/Terminology Variants

- **F1:** External terminology bindings (SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD) provide semantic clarity independent of spelling variants or terminology choices in the archetype text.

- **F2:** When multiple spelling variants exist for the same concept (e.g., "fetus" and "foetus", "haemoglobin" and "hemoglobin"), a single SNOMED CT concept code represents both variants.
  - Example: SNOMED CT code 83418008 represents the concept "Human fetus" regardless of English spelling variant used in an archetype's term text.

- **F3:** Spelling and terminology variants across languages are handled by:
  - Binding the archetype at-code to the correct SNOMED CT concept
  - Using the target language's standard terminology for the translation
  - Allowing the external terminology system to manage semantic equivalence

- **F4:** This approach enables:
  - Consistent English source text without spelling variations
  - Flexible, natural translations in each target language
  - Unambiguous semantic reference through external codes
  - Independent evolution of archetype and terminology systems

## G. Examples of Proper Archetype Language

### Example 1: Concept Definition

**English (Original):**

```text
Concept: Blood Pressure
Purpose: To record the measurement of systemic arterial blood pressure at a specified time.
Description: The force exerted by blood on the walls of arteries during and after each heartbeat,
expressed as systolic/diastolic in mmHg.
```

**Norwegian (Hypothetical Translation):**

```text
Concept: Blodtrykk
Purpose: Å registrere målingen av systemisk arterielt blodtrykk på et spesifisert tidspunkt.
Description: Kraften som blod utøver på arterieveggen under og etter hvert hjerteslag,
uttrykt som systolisk/diastolisk i mmHg.
```

**Key Observations:**

- Phrasing is natural in each language (not literal)
- Clinical meaning is preserved
- Structure, identifiers, and bindings remain unchanged

### Example 2: Data Element Names

**English (Original):**

```text
- Systolic pressure (mmHg)
- Diastolic pressure (mmHg)
- Location tested
- Method used
- Position when examined
```

**German (Hypothetical Translation):**

```text
- Systolischer Blutdruck (mmHg)
- Diastolischer Blutdruck (mmHg)
- Messort
- Messmethode
- Position bei Messung
```

**Key Observations:**

- Terminology is clinically standard in the target language
- Sentence case is maintained in English; German capitalization rules apply in translation
- Element semantics are preserved

---

## H. Prohibited Practices (Translation and Terminology)

- **H1:** Do NOT use spelling variants within a single archetype's English source (e.g., mixing "foetus" and "fetus").

- **H2:** Do NOT create multiple at-codes for spelling or terminology variants of the same clinical concept.

- **H3:** Do NOT translate archetype class names (e.g., ACTION, OBSERVATION, CLUSTER, INSTRUCTION) or internal RM type names.

- **H4:** During translation, NEVER change: node identifiers (at-codes, ac-codes, id-codes); reference model structure or paths; constraints (occurrences, cardinalities); units; value sets; or existing terminology bindings.

- **H5:** Do NOT invent new concepts, merge/split terms, change scope, or alter numeric/code systems when translating.

- **H6:** Do NOT encode locale-specific legal requirements, healthcare system models, or regional medical assumptions in archetype semantics.

- **H7:** Do NOT use colloquialisms, idioms, or culturally-specific language in original English archetype text intended for international reuse.

## K. Available Language Standards Guides

Language-specific extension guides expand this base guide with conventions, terminology, and examples tailored to each language while maintaining the principles of sections A–F.

### Existing Language Guides

- **Norwegian Bokmål** (nb): `openehr://guides/archetypes/language-standards-nb`
  - Norwegian case conventions, metadata patterns, comprehensive terminology glossary
  - Sourced from openEHR KLIM archetype resources and analysis of CKM Norwegian translations
  - Includes glossary maintenance procedures for evolving terminology

- **Dutch** (nl): `openehr://guides/archetypes/language-standards-nl`
  - Dutch case conventions, de/het gender and adjective inflection, metadata patterns, seed terminology glossary
  - Sourced from Nictiz (zib's) and the Dutch SNOMED CT edition / Nationale Release; seed glossary from a real translation task
  - Includes glossary maintenance procedures and flags unverified terms "(needs review)" to avoid fabricated preferred terms

### Future Language Guides

Language-specific guides MAY be created following the pattern: `language-standards-<iso-639-1-code>.md`

Examples: `language-standards-de.md` (German), `language-standards-fr.md` (French), `language-standards-sv.md` (Swedish)

Each language guide SHALL:

- Establish clinical terminology standards for the target language
- Document established translations of common archetype terms
- Provide examples of Purpose/Use/Misuse statements in the target language
- Reference authoritative clinical terminology sources for the language/locale
- Maintain consistency with this base English language standards guide
- Include guidance on glossary maintenance as new archetypes are published with translations

### Cross-Language Terminology Equivalence

When concepts translate to different terminology across languages, semantic equivalence is maintained through external terminology bindings (SNOMED CT, LOINC), not through identical phrasing across language guides.

**Example:** The concept "unsure" may translate to different Norwegian or German terms appropriate to each language's clinical register, but all translations bind to the same SNOMED CT concept code, ensuring unambiguous semantic reference.

Each language guide MAY specify terminology choices appropriate for that language while documenting the clinical reasoning when terminology differs significantly from literal translation.
