## 1. Modelling Principle

> Constrain only what is universally and clinically true.

Archetypes optimise for reuse and safety, not local workflows.

---

## 2. Existence

**Existence** constrains `C_ATTRIBUTE` — whether an attribute value must be present. (Present in both AOM 1.4 and AOM 2.)

- Allowed values (ADL 1.4): `{0}`/`{0..0}` (attribute prohibited), `{0..1}` (optional), `{1}`/`{1..1}` (mandatory); default when unstated is `{1..1}`
- Mandatory only when intrinsic to the concept
- Optional by default

**Note:** Existence applies to attributes. For object-level optionality, use **occurrences**.

---

## 3. Cardinality & Occurrences

**Cardinality** (on container attributes like `items`, `events`) defines how many children the container may hold.

- **Default for containers:** `1..*` (at least one child; empty containers are semantically invalid)
- Single vs repeating reflects real-world semantics
- Avoid `0..*` defaults (an empty container has no meaning)
- Upper bounds must be clinically justified

**Occurrences** (on object nodes) defines how many times an object may appear in its parent; separate from cardinality. Default when unstated (ADL 1.4) is `{1..1}`; `{0}`/`{0..0}` prohibits the node.

**Consistency:** the interval (sum of sibling occurrences minima)..(sum of sibling occurrences maxima) must lie inside the container's cardinality interval (validator-tooling check `VCOC`).

---

## 4. Slots

Use slots when:
- Content varies by context
- Multiple domain-specific implementations exist
- Reuse across specialisations is expected

Constraints:
- Constrain by archetype type and purpose
- Avoid unconstrained slots
- Document intended usage

---

## 5. Clusters vs Elements

- **CLUSTER** = inseparable group
- **ELEMENT** = atomic value
- Never use clusters as generic containers

**Ordered rating-scale leaf:** DV_ORDINAL (integer rungs) or DV_SCALE (Real rungs, RM ≥ 1.1.0) — see `openehr://guides/archetypes/adl-idioms-cheatsheet` §5.

---

## 6. Avoid Over-Constraint

Do not encode:
- UI layout
- Workflow
- Local business rules
- Template logic

These belong in **templates**.

---

## 7. Structural Anti-Patterns

- Everything mandatory
- Deep nesting without semantics
- Slots as modelling shortcuts

---

## 8. Review Questions

- Is this universally true?
- Does this limit reuse?
- Should this be a template concern?
